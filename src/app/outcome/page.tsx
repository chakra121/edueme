            Learning Outcomes of Robotics:
          </h1>
          <p className="p-3 text-center">
            Robots education is pleased to offer free interactive robotics
            presentations for your students!. These fun and hands-on robotics
            sessions will have your students marveling at what THEY can achieve.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a growing economy that has a higher demand for STEM fields,
            it’s important that the next generation learns how they can make a
            difference in their world. That’s why Edueme Research Labs offers a
            variety of classes and workshops that kids of all ages can enjoy.
            Robotics camps and classes give students the opportunity to dive
            deep into the world of robotics and explore how computer programming
            and robot design can solve problems big and small!.
            <br />
            <br />
            Not only do our robotics programs help to establish science,
            technology, engineering, and math concepts, they also work to build
            on students’ team-building skills as they work to complete fun
            challenges. These collaborative skills are essential for student
            success, no matter what subject they choose to pursue in the future.

            - Improved creative thinking skills

          <h1 className="text-center text-lg font-bold">Build Confidence:</h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            Robotics programs for kids are beneficial because they help to build
            confidence. Kids learn to be confident in their ideas and bring them
            to light, sometimes literally. They realize they can make things
            that other people can use. This makes them feel confident that they
            are positively contributing to the world around them.

            Encourage Perseverance:
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            Children also learn perseverance during robotics programs. Projects
            very rarely come out right the first time. This is how kids learn to
            keep going and never give up, no matter how hard it may seem.

          <h1 className="text-center text-lg font-bold">Accept Criticism:</h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            Another benefit of robotics programs is learning how to accept
            constructive criticism. It can be difficult for people of all ages
            to hear that their idea may not be the best or that they need to fix
            something. But, these pieces of advice can help us all succeed.
            Children learn how to use these pieces of criticism to their
            advantage to improve their projects.

          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            Robotics encourages hands-on learning. It can help to improve
            concentration and attention levels which can make kids more engaged
            in the classroom. Robotics for kids can also help to improve
            concentration.

            Improves Programming Skills:
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            Robotics for kids helps to introduce the basics of programming to
            kids. Since robotics is hands-on, children usually find it
            interesting.

          </h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            When children take part in robotics, they also learn how to work
            together. Often, kids work together on projects and learn how to
            socialize and bounce ideas off of one another. This is a skill they
            can use their entire lives.

            Preparing for the Future:
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            Robotics for kids is also important because it is the wave of the
            future. If children can get on board now, they will be better off as
            they get older. Recent statistics indicated that the robotics job
            outlook was expected to grow an average of four percent between 2018
            and 2028. Giving children the skills they need now to compete in
            that job market as they get older is of the utmost importance.

            At What Age Should I Introduce My Child to Robotics?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-center font-normal">
            The answer will differ depending on your child because children
            develop at different stages. Some children may be ready for robotics
            for beginners at age 6 while others would be best suited to start at
            age 8 or 9. You know your child best. If you think a class for
            6-year-olds would be age-appropriate,try it. If not, you can wait
            until they’re a couple of years older.
